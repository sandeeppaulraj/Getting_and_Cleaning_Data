## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

In this repository all the files relating to the course project for the Coursera Course
"Getting and Cleaning Data" can be found.

* First download the contents of the data set(which is in the form of a zip file) to a folder;
  e.g C:\Coursera\DataScience\Getting_Cleaning_Data\Assignment

* Then unzip the contents of the zip folder. After unzipping we will end up with a folder that will be
  like C:\Coursera\DataScience\Getting_Cleaning_Data\Assignment\getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset\UCI HAR Dataset

* In the above folder the run_analysis.R script can be placed.

* In R studio, issue setwd() with the appropriate path to ensure that we are pointing to the data set

* Then do source("run_analysis.R")

* The tidy_data text file will be created.
